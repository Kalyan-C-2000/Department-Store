# Department-Store


## Introduction
### The purpose of this data analysis project is to gain insights into a department store's operations using SQL and Python. The project focuses on analyzing sales data, customer behavior, and employee performance to inform decision-making processes and improve overall store efficiency.

## Data Sources
The data for this analysis was sourced from internal databases containing information about product sales, customer demographics, and employee performance. The data included attributes such as product categories, sales volumes, customer IDs, employee IDs, and transaction dates.

## Data Preparation

Before conducting the analysis, data preprocessing steps were performed, including cleaning the data, handling missing values, converting data types, and aggregating data where necessary. This ensured that the data was ready for analysis and visualization.

## Analysis and Insights

Sales Analysis: Analyzed total sales by product category to identify top-selling categories and trends over time. Visualizations such as bar charts and area charts were used to illustrate sales distribution and seasonal trends.
Customer Behavior Analysis: Explored customer demographics to understand purchasing patterns, peak buying times, and preferences for specific product categories. This information was valuable for targeted marketing strategies.
Employee Performance Analysis: Assessed total sales generated by employees to identify top performers and areas for improvement. Bar charts and scatter plots were used to visualize sales distribution across employees.
Product Performance Analysis: Examined top-selling products, average prices by category, and the relationship between product price and quantity sold. This analysis informed inventory management and pricing strategies.
